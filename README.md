# How to Deploy 

- for a small project I mostly deploy it to Netlify 
- for a bigger one, I use Jenkins with AWS, and get three servers (developement, staging, production)

## Problems I had: 

API has a Cors Problem, I had to create a small server that works as a proxy for the API to work 

### To do 

- work more on UI 
- add loading
- add tests 
- create types 
- add controls and filters
